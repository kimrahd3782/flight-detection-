### ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- My IBM badges are verified on **Credly** â€” you can find the actual badge URLs linked above.
- Google Cloud Skills Boost does **not** issue Credly badges, so for those, I have provided my **Google Cloud Skills Boost public profile link** instead.
- I have also uploaded screenshots of my learning path completions for additional proof.
