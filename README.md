✈️ Flight Delays Prediction Using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project predicts flight delays using machine learning models trained on synthetic or real flight data. The system is deployed as a Flask web application where users can input flight details to get a delay prediction. The goal is to enhance travel planning, improve airline operations, and support airport authority decisions.

🚀 Features
Predicts whether a flight will be delayed (>15 minutes)

Uses historical data, airport codes, airlines, and time of departure

User-friendly web interface built with Flask

Random Forest Classifier for prediction

Synthetic dataset generator included
